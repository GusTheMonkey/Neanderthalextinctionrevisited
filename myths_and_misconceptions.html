    <h2>Neanderthals and Intellectual Inferiority: A Reevaluation</h2>
    <p>Historically, the intellectual capacities of Neanderthals were underestimated due to misapplications of craniology and phrenology, disciplines that equated skull morphology with cognitive ability. Recent research challenges these outdated perspectives and suggests a far more complex narrative surrounding Neanderthal extinction (Luchetti, 2022).</p>

    <section>
      <h3>The Legacy of Craniology and Phrenology</h3>
      <p>In the 19th century, the emerging disciplines of craniology and phrenology significantly influenced perceptions of Neanderthal intelligence. These studies posited a correlation between skull shape and cognitive capacity, often attributing intellectual inferiority to species with certain cranial features. This framework led to deeply biased conclusions, many of which persist today. The assumption that skull size directly reflects brain function was critically flawed and failed to account for the complex social and environmental factors influencing cognitive evolution (Luchetti, 2022; Zilhão, 2012).</p>

      <p class="quote">"The existence of pervasive explicit racial, sexual, and class biases in the work of craniologists has been amply demonstrated and, in my view, does not require further support." — Luchetti, M. (2022)</p>

      <h3>Ecological and Demographic Factors in Neanderthal Extinction</h3>
      <p>Contrary to early assumptions, the extinction of Neanderthals was not solely due to cognitive inferiority but rather a combination of demographic, ecological, and genetic factors. Researchers such as Degioanni et al. (2019) and Vaesen et al. (2019) have highlighted the role of small, isolated populations and the negative effects of inbreeding and genetic bottlenecks. Neanderthals were also likely affected by environmental shifts and the spread of diseases, which may have contributed to their decline. The competition with Homo sapiens, while important, was not the only factor driving their extinction (Finlayson & Carrión, 2007; Degioanni et al., 2019).</p>

      <h3>The Neanderthal Legacy in Modern Humans</h3>
      <p>Recent genomic analyses have revealed that Neanderthals did not merely vanish, but contributed genetically to modern human populations. Studies have demonstrated that modern humans carry Neanderthal DNA, particularly in regions related to immune function and other adaptive traits (Green et al., 2010; Zhou et al., 2022). This genetic legacy underscores the complex interrelations between Homo sapiens and Neanderthals, suggesting extensive interaction, including interbreeding, rather than replacement (Green et al., 2010).</p>

      <h3>Why Did Early Science Misunderstand Neanderthals?</h3>
      <p>Early scientific misconceptions of Neanderthals can be traced to methodological biases, including the undue emphasis on skull measurements as a determinant of intelligence. This reductionist approach overlooked the broader ecological and social factors that shaped Neanderthal behavior. Today, the body of evidence from archaeology, genetics, and anthropology paints a picture of a highly adaptive, culturally rich species capable of complex behaviors (Zilhão, 2012; Sano et al., 2019).</p>

      <h3>Reconsidering Neanderthals: Implications for Human Evolution</h3>
      <p>The reexamination of Neanderthals urges us to reconsider our understanding of human evolution. By moving beyond outdated theories of racial and intellectual hierarchy, we can better appreciate the complexities of Neanderthal behavior and their role in the broader narrative of human history.</p>
