    <h2>Neanderthals are dumb because of skull shape?</h2>
    <p>For a long time, we believed Neanderthals were inferior to Homo sapiens due to outdated disciplines like craniology and phrenology.</p>

    <section>
      <h3>The Impact of Craniology and Phrenology</h3>
      <p>In the 19th century, the emerging field of craniology (the study of skull shapes) and the pseudoscience of phrenology (the study of the skull's bumps and depressions) played a major role in shaping how Neanderthals were viewed. Early scientists linked their skull features to supposed intellectual inferiority. These pseudosciences falsely equated skull size with brain function, leading to biased conclusions about Neanderthal intelligence.</p>

      <p class="quote">"The existence of pervasive explicit racial, sexual, and class biases in the work of craniologists has been amply demonstrated and, in my view, does not require further support." — Luchetti, M. (2022)</p>

      <h3>What Really Caused the Neanderthal Extinction?</h3>
      <p>It's unlikely that Neanderthals disappeared solely due to a lack of intellect. In reality, their extinction was likely a combination of demographic factors, including small, isolated populations and susceptibility to diseases. Homo sapiens’ genetic advantage likely played a role, but the idea of a straightforward “competition” scenario is overly simplistic.</p>

      <h3>Neanderthal Legacy in Modern Humans</h3>
      <p>Genetic research shows that Neanderthals didn’t just disappear—they contributed to our DNA. This suggests that rather than being replaced by Homo sapiens, the two species interacted and even interbred. Modern humans carry a piece of Neanderthal heritage, challenging the outdated narrative of Neanderthals as a failed offshoot.</p>

    <section>
      <h3>Why Did We Misunderstand Neanderthals?</h3>
      <p>Much of our misunderstanding of Neanderthals can be traced back to the biases of early scientific thinking, particularly the emphasis on skull measurements. These methods were used to draw conclusions about intelligence based on an incomplete understanding of human evolution. Today, we know that Neanderthals were adaptive, complex, and capable beings.</p>

    <section>
      <h3>Lessons from Neanderthals</h3>
      <p>The legacy of Neanderthals challenges us to rethink how we view the past. By moving beyond outdated scientific practices, like craniology and phrenology, we can better understand the complex relationships that shaped human evolution.</p>
