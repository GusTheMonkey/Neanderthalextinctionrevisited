    <h2>Were Neanderthals Really That Different?</h2>
    <p>We once painted Neanderthals as dull, brutish cavemen. But the evidence tells a more complex—and much more human—story.</p>

    <section>
      <h3>They Made Art</h3>
      <p>Neanderthals were expressing themselves. Archaeologists have found pendants, beads, body paint, musical instruments, honorific burials, and engraved objects of expression at Neanderthal sites. These items and practices weren’t just practical—they were symbolic, meaning Neanderthals had the capacity for abstract thought.</p>
      <p>For years, scientists dismissed these finds as “contaminated” by modern humans, even when there was no evidence of Homo sapiens nearby. Researcher João Zilhão has pointed out the double standard: similar objects were accepted as proof of culture when found with early Homo sapiens, but questioned when tied to Neanderthals.</p>

        <h3>They Invented Tools</h3>
        <p>Neanderthals weren’t copying anyone—they were innovating. The Schöningen spears, for example, were aerodynamic wooden weapons designed for long-range hunting. They’re older than any similar tools associated with Homo sapiens.</p>
        <p>Some researchers used to believe that more complex “Aurignacian” tools could only be made by Homo sapiens. But Clive Finlayson and José Carrión have argued that tool types were more about geography and environment than intelligence—different groups just used what worked best where they lived.</p>

      <h3>They Were Like Us</h3>
      <p>We didn’t just compete with Neanderthals—we interbred with them. Genetic studies show that billions of people today carry traces of Neanderthal DNA. That means we shared more than just territory. We shared relationships, attraction, and families.</p>
      <p>This level of interaction suggests emotional depth, communication, and complex social bonds—traits that speak to intelligence and culture. The Neanderthal legacy lives on in modern humans to this day.</p>
