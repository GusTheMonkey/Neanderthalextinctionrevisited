    <h2>Why Did Neanderthals Go Extinct?</h2>
    <p>While many once believed that Neanderthals were outcompeted by early humans, recent studies suggest their extinction was more likely due to <strong>genetic vulnerabilities</strong> and <strong>disease</strong>.</p>

    <section>
      <h3>Genetic Weaknesses</h3>
      <p>One of the major reasons for Neanderthal extinction was their small, isolated populations. This made them more susceptible to genetic issues due to <strong>inbreeding</strong> and <strong>genetic homogeneity</strong>.</p>
      <p>Studies have shown that Neanderthals had harmful mutations in genes like <strong>UNC13D</strong> and <strong>MOGS</strong>, linked to severe immune deficiencies. These genetic flaws weakened their ability to resist infections, making them particularly vulnerable to disease outbreaks.</p>

    <section>
      <h3>The Allee Effect</h3>
      <p>Neanderthals faced another challengeâ€”the <strong>Allee effect</strong>. Small, fragmented populations struggle to find mates and maintain genetic diversity, making them more prone to extinction. This demographic vulnerability likely contributed to their decline long before Homo sapiens arrived.</p>
      <p>As their population dwindled, Neanderthals were unable to recover, even without competition from modern humans. This population instability was worsened by the gradual decline in fertility among younger females, further pushing them toward collapse.</p>

    <section>
      <h3>Vulnerability to Disease</h3>
      <p>On top of their genetic issues, Neanderthals also had low genetic diversity, which made them highly susceptible to new diseases. When diseases spread, their small populations lacked the genetic diversity needed to survive outbreaks, further contributing to their eventual extinction.</p>
      <p>Research by Zhou et al. (2022) reveals that Neanderthals were likely ill-equipped to resist infections, which would have decimated their already fragile populations.</p>
